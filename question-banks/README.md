# Question Banks Directory

This directory contains JSON files for IELTS Speaking Practice question banks. Question banks are loaded dynamically based on the `?bank=` URL parameter.

## How to Add a New Question Bank

### Step 1: Create a JSON File

Create a new JSON file in this directory with your bank ID as the filename (e.g., `travel.json`).

### Step 2: Define the Question Bank Structure

Use the following structure:

```json
{
  "id": "travel",
  "name": "Travel & Tourism",
  "description": "Questions about travel experiences and tourism",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "version": "1.0",
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "travel-q1",
      "type": "part1",
      "text": "Do you enjoy traveling?",
      "speakingDuration": 20
    },
    {
      "id": "travel-q2",
      "type": "part2",
      "text": "Describe a memorable trip you have taken.",
      "speakingDuration": 120,
      "card": {
        "title": "Describe a memorable trip you have taken.",
        "subtitle": "You should say:",
        "bullets": [
          "where you went",
          "when you went there",
          "what you did",
          "explain why it was memorable"
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "travel-q3",
      "type": "part3",
      "text": "How has tourism changed in recent years?",
      "speakingDuration": 60
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 3: Update the Manifest (Optional)

Add your bank ID to `manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "banks": [
    "technology",
    "education",
    "environment",
    "travel"
  ]
}
```

**Note**: The manifest is optional. Banks can be loaded directly via URL parameter even if not listed in the manifest.

### Step 4: Access Your Question Bank

Use the URL parameter to load your bank:

```
https://your-app.com/?bank=travel
```

## Question Types

## Best Practices

1. **Question IDs**: Use descriptive, unique IDs (e.g., `travel-q1`, `tech-part2-1`)
2. **Question Order**: Mix question types for variety
3. **Cue Cards**: Always include cue cards for Part 2 questions
4. **Media**: Use high-quality, relevant media content
5. **Duration**: Follow IELTS standard durations
6. **Validation**: Test your JSON file for syntax errors before deploying

## Testing Your Question Bank

1. Save your JSON file in this directory
2. Access the app with `?bank=your-bank-id`
3. Verify all questions load correctly
4. Test recording and playback functionality
5. Check that cue cards display properly for Part 2

## Troubleshooting

### Bank Not Loading
- Check JSON syntax (use a JSON validator)
- Verify file is in `/public/question-banks/` directory
- Check browser console for error messages
- Ensure bank ID in URL matches filename (without .json)

### Questions Not Displaying
- Verify `questions` array is not empty
- Check that all required fields are present
- Ensure question types are lowercase (`"part1"`, not `"Part1"`)

### Cue Card Not Showing
- Verify question type is `"part2"`
- Check that `card` object has all required fields
- Ensure `bullets` array has at least one item

## Examples

See the existing question banks for reference:
- `technology.json` - Technology and innovation topics
- `education.json` - Education and learning topics
- `environment.json` - Environmental issues and nature
